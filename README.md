# PenguinPOS QA Agent

PenguinPOS QA Agent is a Flutter desktop application for planning and running
repeatable QA checks against configured PenguinPOS **non-production** targets.
It combines deterministic Flutter Driver automation with a constrained
plain-language assistant. The assistant prepares structured plans; the QA
application remains responsible for validation and execution.

## Safety first

- Production and live targets are never executable from the assistant.
- A target must resolve to a configured, approved non-production profile before
  a validated plan can run.
- Credentials and PINs are entered through the secure settings flow. They are
  never requested, echoed, or stored in chat messages.
- Model output is treated as untrusted input. It is decoded, normalised, and
  validated before it can become an automation scenario.
- The assistant displays user-safe lifecycle details, not private model
  reasoning, prompts, or hidden instructions.

## What the assistant supports today

| Workflow | Plain-language examples | Required details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Login and terminal checks | `test the login flow in kpn dev` | A configured non-production profile; credentials must already be configured securely. |
| Cash order checks | `create two orders in kpn stage: SKU 22, non-weighed, manual` | Target profile, SKU(s), item type, and entry method. Weighed items also require a positive weight. |
| Repeat a previous order | `repeat the previous order in kpn dev` | An earlier user message in the same chat containing valid item details. |

For multiple orders, state whether every order uses the same items or give the
items for each order. The assistant does not silently choose a SKU, item type,
weight, or entry method from an example or from unrelated chat history.

Examples of clear order requests:

```text
Create one order in kpn stage with SKU 22, non-weighed, manual entry.
Create two orders in kpn dev: order 1 has SKU 22, non-weighed, manual;
order 2 has SKU 10000001, weighed, 1.763 kg, scan.
Repeat the previous order in kpn dev.
```

If a request is incomplete or ambiguous, the assistant asks for the missing
information instead of executing. Unknown, disabled, or production targets are
also stopped with an explanation.

## Chat and execution experience

The chat is the primary workspace:

1. The assistant parses the request and resolves the configured profile.
2. It validates the structured plan against guardrails.
3. A valid plan for an approved non-production profile starts execution.
4. The chat receives a compact result card; order suites show one result for
   every requested order plus the checks applied to each order.

Every assistant response may include a collapsed **Planning details** panel.
It contains safe milestones such as “Parsing request”, “Matching target
profile”, and “Validating plan”. It deliberately excludes raw model
chain-of-thought, private reasoning, prompts, secrets, and driver commands.
The bottom execution log is a secondary diagnostic view, not the main way to
understand a run.

## Architecture

The project is structured by responsibility so GUI, planning, and driver code
remain independent:

```text
lib/
  ai/                 Constrained planning, model providers, plan contracts
  automation/         Deterministic login and order driver scenarios
  core/               Scenario models, results, parsing, and reporting
  interfaces/
    gui/              Desktop UI, assistant chat, settings, and suite screens
    cli/              Command-line adapter
    mcp/              MCP adapter and request validation
  runtime/            App launcher, driver engine, profiles, and sessions
scenarios/            Declarative YAML scenarios
test/                 Unit, contract, orchestration, and widget tests
docs/                 PenguinPOS integration requirements
```

Useful entry points:

- `lib/main.dart` starts the desktop application.
- `lib/ai/orchestration/ai_orchestrator.dart` turns a user request into a
  validated plan without executing driver commands itself.
- `lib/interfaces/gui/dashboard/screens/assistant/` owns the chat UI and its
  rich execution-report cards.
- `lib/automation/` owns deterministic interaction with PenguinPOS.

## Running locally

Install Flutter and project dependencies, then run:

```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Run the test suite with:

```sh
flutter test
```

Before submitting a change, format the entire repository and run the quality
checks from the project root:

```sh
dart format .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

The CLI and MCP adapters prompt for required values that have not been supplied
instead of relying on embedded credentials or target settings.

## PenguinPOS application contract

The external driver requires debug-only Flutter Driver support and stable widget
keys in the PenguinPOS application. The complete, current key contract and
debug-build requirements are in [docs/penguin_pos_requirements.md](docs/penguin_pos_requirements.md).

## Contributing

- Keep Flutter GUI code feature-oriented and use package imports within `lib/`.
- Keep model plans and driver actions separate: planning must not bypass runtime
  safety checks.
- Add tests with behaviour changes, particularly for target safety, malformed
  model output, missing input, and rich execution reporting.
- Run `dart format .` from the repository root before analysis or tests. Do
  not format only a hand-picked list of files.
- Do not add credentials, PINs, or production target defaults to source, tests,
  documentation, or chat examples.
